# Pygame-Flappy-Bird-TJ
A Flappy Bird clone built with Python and Pygame. Control a bird that flaps to ascend and sinks otherwise, navigating through pipe gaps to score points. Avoid collisions with pipes or the screen edges to keep playing. This project covers sprite handling, animation, collision detection, and scoring.
